# Particles demo

Some canvas-based particle effects.

## Browser

The demos have been tested on a Macbook Air running Chrome v27, Firefox v21, and Safari v6.1.

They have also been tested on IE 10 / Windows 8.

## Running

The demos can be viewed either as standalone files within this ZIP file, or viewed online:

Some work-in-progress examples can be seen here:

## Additional features

Each demo includes settings for the particle generation rate, gravity, starting position (X and Y axes). The main (index) demo also includes a setting for particle direction and moveable walls.

Arcs have been used instead of rectangles on the main (index) demo to make it look more like bouncing balls.
