Some canvas-based particle effects.

## Examples

Each example contains sliders to control various properties. The examples are:

* [Main bouncing ball example](http://hop.ie/particles/)
* [Fountain example](http://hop.ie/particles/fountain.html)

## Browsers

The demos have been tested on a Macbook Air running Chrome v27, Firefox v21, and Safari v6.1.

They have also been tested on IE 10 / Windows 8.

## Works in progress

Some work-in-progress examples can be seen here:
